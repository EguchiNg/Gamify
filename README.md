Gamify
======

This project is a game engine that will hopefully be implemented to allow for gamifying the workplace, by allowing users to earn experience by completing real-life activities which gives in-game perks.

Currently the implementation is a simple dungeon crawler that allows you to fight goblins in a text based format.
To play, take the Gamify.jar file and put it in a location on your computer. Then, run it using the command java -jar Gamify2.jar

Command line:
Put all the files in src in one folder. Then, compile using scalac *.scala. Finally, run by using "scala GameBase" (May need to do "scala GameBase.scala")
